Task 1: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Retail Sales

Goal: Understand customer purchase behavior through exploratory analysis of a retail dataset.

Steps:

Cleaned dataset (removed duplicates, handled missing values, corrected data types).

Added Sales = Quantity × UnitPrice.

Generated descriptive statistics (mean, std, unique products/customers).

Visualized sales distribution, top products, and sales trends over time.

Key Insights:

Few products contribute most of the revenue.

Seasonal spikes in sales (holiday effect).

Small group of loyal customers drives major revenue.

Many small-value orders, few large-value ones.

Growth potential in promoting top categories.
